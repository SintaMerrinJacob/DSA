You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with two integers, 'i,' and 'j.' Swap the nodes that are present at the 'i-th' and 'j-th' positions.

Remember, the nodes themselves must be swapped and not the datas.



Node *swapNodes(Node *head, int i, int j)
{
    //case 1: Head is NULL or only single element
    if(head == NULL || head -> next == NULL)
        return head;
     // when the nodes to be swapped are same
    if ( i==j )
        return head;
    
	Node   *iprev = NULL   ,   *inode = NULL ;
    Node   *jprev = NULL   ,   *jnode = NULL ;
    int pos = 0;
    Node *curr = head;
    
    while( pos < i -1 && curr != NULL )
           {
               pos++;
               curr = curr -> next;
           }
          iprev = curr;
          inode = curr -> next;
         
        
        pos = 0;
        curr = head;
        while( pos < j -1 && curr != NULL )
           {
               pos++;
               curr = curr -> next;
           }
          jprev = curr;
          jnode = curr -> next;
          
        
        iprev -> next = jnode;
        jprev -> next = inode;
        Node * temp = inode -> next;
        inode -> next = jnode -> next;
        jnode -> next = temp;
        
        
        
        
        
    
    return head;
}
