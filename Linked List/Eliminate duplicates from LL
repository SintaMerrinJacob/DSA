You have been given a singly linked list of integers where the elements are sorted in ascending order. 
Write a function that removes the consecutive duplicate values such 
that the given list only contains unique elements and returns the head to the updated list.



Node *removeDuplicates(Node *head)
{
    if(head == NULL || head -> next == NULL)
        return head;
    
    Node *curr =head;
   
    while(curr->next != NULL)
    {
        if(curr -> data == curr -> next -> data )
        {
            Node *a = curr -> next;
            curr -> next = a -> next;
            delete a;
          
        }
        else
        {
             curr = curr -> next;
        }
        
    }      
    return head;
}
