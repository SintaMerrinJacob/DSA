Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once. 
Find the element that occurs once. The expected time complexity is O(n) and O(1) extra space. 

int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums)
    {
        int singleoccurence = 0; // stores element that occurs one time
        int twooccurence = 0;    // stores element that occurs twice
        // both will reject an arr[i] that occurs thrice;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.size() ;i++)
        {
            singleoccurence = (singleoccurence^nums[i]) & (~twooccurence);
            twooccurence    = (twooccurence^nums[i]) & (~singleoccurence);
        }
        
        return singleoccurence;
    }
