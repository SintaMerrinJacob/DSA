Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.


void sumOfTwoArrays(int *input1, int size1, int *input2, int size2, int *output)
{
    int i = size1 - 1;
    int j = size2 - 1;
    int k = 1 + max(size1,size2) - 1;
    int carry = 0;
    while( i>=0 && j>=0)
    {  
        int sum = input1[i] + input2[j] + carry;
        if(  sum< 10 )
        {
            carry = 0;
            output[k--] = sum;
            i--;
            j--;
        }
        else 
        {
            carry = 1;
            output[k--] = sum%10;
            i--;
            j--;
        }
        
    }
    
    while(i>=0)
    {
        output[k--] = input1[i--];
    }
    
    while(j>=0)
    {
        output[k--] = input1[j--];
    }
    
    if (carry == 1)
        output[0] = 1;
    else
        output[0] = 0;
    
    
}
