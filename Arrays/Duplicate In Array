You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. 
That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3, and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. 
You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.


int findDuplicate(int *arr, int n)
{
    int ans1 = 0;
    int ans2 = 0;
    for(int i = 0 ; i<=n-2 ; i++)
        ans1 = ans1 ^ i;
    for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++)
        ans2 = ans2 ^ arr[i];
    
    return ans1 ^ ans2;
}
